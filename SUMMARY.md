## Files Created

1. **examples/advanced_usage.py**
   - Added demonstration of caching functionality
   - Added demonstration of retry with backoff functionality

2. **test_features.py**
   - Added unit tests for caching behavior
   - Added unit tests for retry behavior

3. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Created changelog file to track version changes
   - Added entries for versions 0.1.0 and 0.2.0

4. **docs/caching_and_retry.md**
   - Created detailed documentation of the caching system
   - Created detailed documentation of the retry with backoff mechanism
   - Added code examples and best practices

5. **SDK_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md**
   - Added section on updating the changelog with each release

## Technical Implementations

### Caching System
- In-memory caching with TTL-based expiration
- Different TTLs for different data types:
  - Network data: 24 hours
  - Pool data: 5 minutes
  - Token data: 10 minutes
  - Statistics: 15 minutes
  - Default: 5 minutes
- MD5 hash-based cache keys for consistent lookup
- Support for skipping cache and custom TTLs
- Cache clearing by endpoint prefix

### Retry with Backoff
- Automatic retry for connection errors, timeouts, and server errors (5xx)
- No retry for client errors (4xx)
- Exponential backoff with configurable times
- Default backoff schedule: 100ms, 500ms, 1s, 5s
- Random jitter to prevent thundering herd problem
- Configurable maximum retry attempts

## Testing
- Unit tests verify both caching and retry behavior
- Tests use mocking to simulate API behavior
- Coverage includes:
  - Basic caching functionality
  - Caching with parameters
  - Cache invalidation
  - Retry on connection errors
  - Retry on server errors
  - No retry on client errors
  - Maximum retry limit

## Documentation
- README updated with feature overview and basic examples
- Detailed documentation created in docs/
- Examples provided for all major use cases
- Best practices included

## Version Management
- Version bumped from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0
- CHANGELOG created to track version history
- Update instructions enhanced to include changelog maintenance
